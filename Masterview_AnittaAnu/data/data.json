		"description":"Bruhathkayosaurus meaning 'huge bodied lizard') is a dinosaur, with remains found in India, that some researchers claim to have been the largest dinosaur that ever lived. Estimates of size exceed the titanosaur Argentinosaurus, as longer than 35 metres (115 ft) and weighing over 80-100 tons. The accuracy of this claim, however, has been mired in controversy and debate. Until the remains are properly described, the validity of the genus and any size estimates will be questionable."

This bipedal/quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaur is known for its distinctive hollow cranial crest, which in the best-known species resembled a hatchet. Several possible species have been named, from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, but only the two Canadian species are currently recognized as valid."

The genus gets its name from Linhe, a city near the site where the fossil was first found and Greek nykus, 'claw'. The specific name is derived from Greek monos, 'single', and daktylos, 'finger', a reference to the fact that it is the only known non-avian dinosaur to have had but a single digit."

Like all pterosaurs, Pterodactylus had wings formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated fourth finger to its hind limbs."
